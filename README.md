# LOL analysis by PySpark

# Introduction
League of Legends (abbreviated LoL or League) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Originally inspired by Valveâ€™s Defense of the Ancients (DotA), the game has followed a freemium model since its release on October 27, 2009. League of Legends is often cited as the world's largest e-sport, with an international competitive scene.

# Project description

his project tries to simulate the lifecycle of a real-life analytics project. The project aims to deliver useful information to players or developers that will help make profitable business decisions.

In this project we used a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/d4sein/league-of-legends-patch-109) dataset called League of Legends 2020 - patch 10.9

# Project tasks
We were asked to do the following tasks
  - [Batch] Champion win, pick, and ban rates 
  - [Batch] Champion Synergies or duos 
  - [Batch] Item win, pick rates 
  - [Batch] Item Synergies (item with champion, item with class) 
  - [Batch] Item suggestion (has to be for at least 2 champions) 

After we provide such an analysis which you can visulaize [here](https://github.com/MG-98/LOL-pyspark/blob/main/Visualization.ipynb), we were asked to propose some new
